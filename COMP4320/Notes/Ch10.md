# Ch.10 Parallelism and Concurrency

## Objectives

- Describe the difference between concurrency and parallelism
- Identify when to use multiprocessing
- Identify when to use multithreading
- Understand the implications of the __GIL__
- Use a worker pool to distribute work
- Use a queue to gather and distribute work.

## Concurency vs. Parallelism 

Many terms come to mind when referring to parallelism in programming:
- __Concurent__: a matter of design
- __Parallel__: a matter of execution
- __process__: is an execution environment
- __thread__: a worker that is carrying out instructions within a process. 

## Simple fork/exec Model

The most straightforward approach to parallelism is to let the OS handle it. You can start these processes using _os.fork()_. This creates a _copy_ of the currently-running process. 

## Multiprocessing with _multiprocessing_

This module is available to make translating the _threading_ module easy. You can create multiple _Process_ objects, which will execute a specifc function with a given set of args. 

These _DO NOT_ overlap in memeory, meaning the data to be shard between them must use OS-level objects to share data. 

## Using Pipes

For arbitrary communication between processes, a pipe may be the most flexible choice. These are low-level, but it is generally preferred to use a higher level object such as _pools_ or a _worker pool_.
