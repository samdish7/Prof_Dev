## Objectives

This course is meant to be an introduction to the Python programming language. Python is a scripting langauge, which means it doesn't need a seperate _.exe _file 

### Overview

Object-oriented language, just like C/C++

Dynamically typed program, no need to specify them, just like _auto_ in c++

We will be using python3. The most recent version of py

Open-source and can run on ALL OS. All applications end with a _.py_ extension

Use _python3_ or _python2_ command to execute a script from the command line, or use an IDE such as _IDLE_. 

Many of the scripts we make start with this line: **#!/usr/bin/env python3**. This lets people know we are using the _python3_ environment. Optional but useful

Another IDE is _pycharm_. You can also use notebooks such as _Juypter Notebook/Labs_

TONS of documentation online. Python is one of the most used languages in the world and there are lots of resources about it 

### Naming Conventions

An __Identifier__ is a name used to identify one of the following:
- Variables
- Functions/Methods
- Classes
- Modules

It must start with an letter of the alphabet or an underscore _ and can be followed by any combo of letters, numbers or _

You cannot have any special characters in your names

### Dynamic Types

Python will attempt to figure out the type of data you are trying to make, thus you don't have to give it an explicit type. An example of this is in the _datatypes.py_ script.
