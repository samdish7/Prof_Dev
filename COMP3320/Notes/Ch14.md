# Ch. 14: Debugging; Sam Disharoon; 20220617

## Objectives 
- Use the python std. library's _pdb_ module to debug python programs
- Launch the debugger from an interactive python shell
- Learn and use the various debugger commands withtin the debugging process
- Set break points and evaluate the current contect of the code being debugged

### Intro

While inserting print statements to debug is a common and familiar practice, it is better to learn how to debug. This is where the _pdb_ module comes into play

- It supports setting breakpoints within th ecode and single stepping line by line through Python code
- It supports post-mortem debugging to better understand what was happening when an exception occured
- can be started through and interactive py shell
- can be started through a command line

### Debugger Commands

Some common commands are:
- args	__a__: Print the argument list of the current function
break __b__: Creates a breakpoint (requires parameters) in the program execution
continue  __c__: Continues program execution
help  __h__: Provides list of commands or help for a specified command
jump  __j__: Set the next line to be executed
list  __l__: Print the source code around the current line
next  __n__: Continue execution until the next line in the current function is reached or returns
step  __s__: Execute the current line, stopping at first possible occasion
pp  __pp__: Pretty-prints the value of the expression
quit or exit  __q__: Aborts the program
return  __r__: Continue execution until the current function returns

There are plenty more commands as well and the documentation on them can be found online

### Listing Source

The _list_ command can be used to either list the source code around the currently active line of code in the debugger, or a range can be supplied as to how many lines to show.

### Breakpoints

To stop at a certain point, you can set _breakpoints_ to allow the code to stop where you want it to stop so you can pinpoint the error easier, instead of manually going line-by-line

You can use this in conjunction with the _continue_ command to jump to the next breakpoint that you set. This a very useful tool to help clean up your programs
