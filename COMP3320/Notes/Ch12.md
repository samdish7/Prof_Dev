# Ch. 12: Writing GUIs in Python

## Objectives

- Use the _tkinter_ module from Python's std. library ti create a GUI
- Understand the various tkinter components and the events they trigger
- Use various dialogs that are available in tkinter as top level windows within your program

### Intro

A program with a __Grapical User Iterface__ or __GUI__ is much nicer on the eyes than the standard text based stuff. They usually follow the model below:
- A set of GUI components is placed on display
- The program enters an event loop and waits for an event
- In response, certain pre-arranged code is executed bt the program

There are tons of documents about the features that tkinter uses and the components it comes with

### Dialog and Message Boxes

In larger apps, there are tons of components. We can look at both Dialog and Message boxes as displays. You can use these to show messages you want the user to see. As in you can display warnings to them as well
