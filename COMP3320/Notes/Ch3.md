## Objectives

Look at the various control flows that Python offers. Very similar to other languages. Certain types of statements are:
* if/else
* while
* for
* break/continue

Most of these are common in other languages and they perform the same way

### Indenting Requirements

Python uses indentation to determine what code is within certain statements. There are examples in the exercises folder

For an _if/else_, if you want more than one option, use the _elif_ statement. There are no switch statements in Python

### Relational/Logical Operators

Most are the same as others, but Python adds:
* is
* is not
* and
* or
* not

Which mean the same thing as english terms. Very nice to read for us humans

The _range()_ function is useful as well
