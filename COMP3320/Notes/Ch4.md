# Ch. 4: Collections; Sam Disharoon; 20220614

## Objectives

Different kinds of collections are as follows:
* Lists/Arrays
* Dictionaries
* Tuple
* Sets
* Maps

These are a good way to store large amounts of data without declaring variables for each one. Why write out 100 different ints when you can store them all in 1 data structure

Plenty of functions that go along with these structures, and plenty of documentation on them

Lists act similarly to vectors in c++

All of these structures are created using their respective _constructors_ such as:
* list()
* tuple()
* set()
* dict()

The above are all default constructors, you can utilize other constructors at will

### Lists

A list is an ordered data structure holding zero or more objects

Can be created in several ways:
* list()
* pair of square brakcets to denote an empty list
* pair of square brackets with values seperated by a comma

Indexing starts at 0
